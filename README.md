# Matt's Violin

My local makespace got a 3d printer, and I thought it would be a lot of fun to trying building a violin. I play a little bit of violin but I'm no master and I'm certainly no luthier, with that in mind these are some of my experiences in the process.

## Version 1.0

The 3d printer was an [Ultimaker 3 Extended](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-3) which has dual-extruders so you can print with water-soluble support material.  I had read about the [Hovaline](http://www.hovalabs.com/hova-instruments/hovalin) but I felt attached to the traditional shape of a violin with its scroll and multiple colors.  I found a [blog post](https://formlabs.com/blog/designing-a-3d-printed-acoustic-violin/) from Formlabs detailing a violin they designed and built.  I decided to move forward with that design.  So I started printing.

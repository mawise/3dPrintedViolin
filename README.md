# Matt's Violin

My local makespace got a 3d printer, and I thought it would be a lot of fun to trying building a violin. I play a little bit of violin but I'm no master and I'm certainly no luthier, with that in mind these are some of my experiences in the process.

## Version 1.0

The 3d printer was an [Ultimaker 3 Extended](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-3) which has dual-extruders so you can print with water-soluble support material (PVA).  I had read about the [Hovaline](http://www.hovalabs.com/hova-instruments/hovalin) but I felt attached to the traditional shape of a violin with its scroll and multiple colors.  I found a [blog post](https://formlabs.com/blog/designing-a-3d-printed-acoustic-violin/) from Formlabs detailing a violin they designed and built.  I decided to move forward with that design.  So I started printing.

This part took about five days to print plus two more to dissolve the support material.  It is heavily striated and there are holes where a stream of PVA crossed the path where I wanted my violin to be.

I had much more success printing my parts laying down instead of standing up.  The striations almost look like a wood grain in that orientation and I didn't have any more issues with PVA leaving holes in the finished part.  I needed about four more five-day prints to make the main body and all the little bits.  The design calls for inserting carbon-fiber rods for structural support and the parts have perfectly-sized slots for those rods.  At least the slots are prefectly-sized if you have a perfect 3d printer.  I also found out on these parts that dissolving PVA seems to warm the PLA plastic of the part.

The carbon fiber won't fit, and the plastic is warping, maybe I can sand down the carbon fiber and fill in the gaps with epoxy?  Around this time my local makerspace aquired a [Formlabs Form 2](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-2/).  This is the printer my violin was designed to be built on so I abandoned my first attempt but glued together the parts to create a pretty violin-shaped-object.  I'll probably donate this back to the shop for them to hang on the wall as decoration or something.
